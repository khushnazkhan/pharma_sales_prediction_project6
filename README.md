##  Features

-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Feature Engineering on time-series & promotions
-  ML Models: XGBoost, Random Forest
-  LSTM Deep Learning model
-  Streamlit frontend to upload test file and get predictions
-  Deployed on Streamlit Cloud / Heroku

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

---

##  Challenges Faced

-  GitHub 100MB limit blocked `.pkl` upload â†’ fixed by hosting on Google Drive  
-  Preprocessing large and complex time-series data  
- Memory handling with LSTM models
